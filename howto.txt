Tutorial:  http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html

STARTING GUIDE FOR MY CHROME APP

-> manifest.json tells basic information about your app, like name, description, image, and what javascript has to be called and when.
-> then i created 2 javascript files, one for student login, one for parent login (myscript.js, myscripp.js)
-> JS code is simple, i just catch the verfication text inside the page and put it in the textbox.
-> I used "content script" (in manifest.json file). They attach my javascript files whenever a particular website is opened.

For running the app:
-> See tutorial above.
-> The unpacked folder "vitvc" can be run directly.
-> I have also uploaded the folder as a zip file in dropbox.

-> Now you can make changes to my source files to change any webpage. JavaScript is really powerfull. And you can make other Chrome extensions. Its really easy!

FIREFOX
-> Port these JS files to firefox extension.
